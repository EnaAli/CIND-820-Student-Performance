# CIND-820-Predicting-Student-Performance
Predicting students' performance is crucial for educators, serving as a key indicator of education quality and enabling timely intervention and support for struggling students. In this Capstone project, we focused on forecasting students' performance in Math and Portuguese Language courses. Using the supervised learning algorithm of regression and implementing Multiple Linear Regression models in R programming, we aimed to predict students' final grades (G3) and first-period grades (G1). 
The models were evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE) and were built through a train and test cross-validation approach.

The overall project methodology:
•	Data Selection
