# CIND-820-Predicting-Student-Performance
In this Capstone project,  we are predicting the student performance at two Portuguese high ‎schools in two courses: Math and Portuguese Language using a supervised learning ‎algorithm, namely, regression. We applied Multiple Linear Regression to predict the final ‎grade G3 and first period grade G1.  We split the data to 80% train set and 20% test set for ‎cross-validation. We measured the performance of the models using RMSE.‎
