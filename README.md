# CIND-820-Predicting-Student-Performance
Prediction of students' performance has been a big concern for educators as it is an important measure of ‎the quality of education. In addition, it can be helpful to enable educators to interfere in early learning ‎stages and provide additional support to low-performance.‎

In this Capstone project,  we are predicting the student performance at two Portuguese high ‎schools in two courses: Math and Portuguese Language using a supervised learning ‎algorithm, namely, regression. We used R programming to build  Multiple Linear Regression ‎models to predict the final grade G3 and first-period grade G1.  We applied the train and ‎test cross-validation method and measured the performance of the models using RMSE.‎
