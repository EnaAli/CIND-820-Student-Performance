# MS: 4 students out of 50 in porh 8% where por 14 students of 230 6%
########################################
#more female students got zero in porh when there is almost the same number of students
#less female students got zero in por even there were more female students in por course than male
########################################
# Even the number of students in porh is less than those in por , the failure is higher. and the age in porh is less than por for this group of students.
#######################################
#there are students who got zero in the final grade even they got marks between 4 and 12 in the first porh exam and between 4-11 in por ,on the other hand the range of marks in the second exam was between 0 and 10  in porh and  0 and 9 in por. that might indicate that there are other factors than the grades in first and second exams as in first exam the minimum grade was 4

# Most of the students in this group didn't have previous failure in porh course where in por the maximum was failing one time.
